Welcome to my exploratory analysis of the GPT-2 model using the 
IBM AIHWkit 

To install of the dependencies run this command in your cli
<code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code>

The goal of this project is to research how the gpt-2 model will perform
across various datasets. The two most notable are SQuAD and RACE for LLM
benchmarks. I also choose TLDR_News as the dataset seemed like a good fit for
the task.
